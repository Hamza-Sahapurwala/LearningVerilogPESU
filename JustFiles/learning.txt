iVerilog - Icarus Verilog 
It's a simulation and synthesis tool
Similar to C
Gate Level Implementation:
Using the logic gates in the code

Data Flow Level Implementation:
We can use operator, 

assign - it's going to assign variables values

Module declaration: (module is the start)

module module_name circuit name(port_list);
    port declarations;
    variable declarations;
    description of behaviour
endmodule

module andgate(y,a,b);
    input a,b;
    output y;
    assign y = a & b;
endmodule

For every module, we write a testbench file
